description: Generate Python SDK for agentfs based on the Typescript SDK
---

## Context

- You must generate Python SDK with the API similar to the current Typescript SDK located at ../../sdk/typescript
- You must transfer all tests from Typescript SDK to the Python
- Last time, python sdk was updated based on the comment $1 (if value is "unspecified" then regenerate SDK from scratch; if value is set - focus on the diff between the current state and specified commit hash; note that prompt in .claude directory also can change)
- Use `turso.aio` python package which provide API similar to `aiosqlite`
- Use simple setup with builtin uv ruff formatter
- Use pytest for testing
- Commit your changes in the end with detailed message with the motivation of changes and traces of your actions
- Maintain CI for linting and checking at .github/workflows/python.yml similar to the TS workflow at .github/workflows/typescript.yml

```py

    def __init__(self, connector: Callable[[], BlockingConnection]) -> None:
